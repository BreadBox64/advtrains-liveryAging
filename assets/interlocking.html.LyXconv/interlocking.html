<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >In real-world railways, a so-called interlocking system is a set of railway signals and trackside equipment. Its purpose is to prevent
conflicting train movements which otherwise could result in derailing or colliding trains. If you want more information, just search for
&#8220;railway interlocking&#8221; on the internet.
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >Real-world interlocking systems perform this task by setting routes. A route is a path along a track that a train can safely pass. To set a
route for a train, the signalman (the operator of a signal box) has to set switches (turnouts) to the correct position and lock them in order
to make a signal for a train show &#8220;Proceed&#8221;. In newer systems, this is done automatically by the interlocking system. A route can
not be set if switches are locked to a wrong position by another route or if any portion of the route is occupied by a
train.
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >The interlocking system in this Minetest mod tries to follow real-world interlocking systems as far as applicable. It divides tracks into
track sections and implements a route setting mechanism following the same principle.
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >However, for the sake of simplicity of implementation and usage, not all concepts of real-world interlocking have been taken over.
Especially, there is no mechanism for overlap.
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >If you are looking for a place to learn how real-world interlocking systems work, have a look at &#8220;SimSig&#8221;. By looking at their simulations,
you can obtain experience on how to set up your own interlocking systems in AdvTrains. The SimSig glossary is a good place to look up
unknown terms in this document.

<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >In the real world, a line of track is divided into so-called track sections, or track circuits. Those systems often can not tell
where exactly a train is, but only which track sections it occupies. A route can never be set through an occupied track
section.
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >A track section often covers:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">A section on a main running line, between two signals
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">A single turnout
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">A rail crossing, or a set of turnouts acting as a double/single slip switch
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">A siding</li></ul>

<a

<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >In this mod, you will not directly configure the locations of track sections. Instead, you designate the borders of each track section using a
special node, the Track Circuit Break, abbreviated TCB.
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >For example, if you want to create a track section for a piece of a main running line, you set up two TCBs at the ends of this track
circuit.
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >Setting up a TCB works as follows:
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-6x1">Place a TCB node somewhere near the place where the circuit break is going to be located.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-8x2">Right-click the TCB node
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-10x3">Punch the rail which should act as TCB</li></ol>
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >The result should look like this:

>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >Now you have assigned the TCB node to a rail. Right-click the TCB node once again. This will bring up a form which looks as
follows:
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" ><img

>
<!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >You see that the form is divided in side A and side B. To designate where each side is, a marker is displayed on the rail. You can always
make this marker show up by punching the TCB node, and remove it by punching the marker. Both sides are shown as &#8220;End of
interlocking&#8221;. This means that there is no track section set up at this place.
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >You should repeat this procedure once again a few meters away from the first TCB to create a second TCB on the same
track.
<!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" ><img

>
<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >Once you have both bordering TCBs set up, you can now create the actual track section. To do this:
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-12x1">Right-click one of the TCBs
     </li>
     <li

     <li

<!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" >Now, the text on the formspec has changed. It shows something like this:
<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" ><img

>
<!--l. 123--><p class="noindent" >On the top, you see a list of all TCBs that border this track section. In your case, there should be two TCBs listed. If there&#8217;s only one,
head over to <a 
href="#x1-17r2">2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:Long-track-sections, --></a>. You should now select a name for the track section, to identify it later.
<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >The same procedure is applicable when you create a turnout track section, except that you have to set up three or more
TCBs.
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >The AdvTrains interlocking system allows you to add more TCBs after you have created a track section. This works without problems in
most cases. For example, you can easily insert a turnout into an already set-up track section and create another TCB behind it, and
AdvTrains will automatically detect the existing track section. Problems arise only if you try to insert a TCB in-between a section, in
which case both sides of the TCB will end up assigned to the same section. The code currently does not handle this case properly, so try
to avoid this situation by all means. As a last resort, you can always dissolve a faulty track section, as described in the next
chapter.

<!--l. 233--><p class="noindent" >Every signal is associated to a track on which the instruction should be followed. Signals are usually placed right next to the track on the
right side. Human observers do know then that the signal belongs to the track left of it, however, train safety systems (like the one in
advtrains) can not.
<!--l. 239--><p class="noindent" >This is the reason why a so-called &#8220;influence point&#8221; needs to be assigned to any signal that should actually give instructions to trains,
should the driver (if even there is one) fail to recognize the instructions.
<!--l. 244--><p class="noindent" >Depending on the signal and the mod that adds the signal, there are different ways to configure this. Signals integrated into advtrains
behave as follows:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Static signals and all red-green light signals from core advtrains that are not assigned to a TCB can be configured by
     holding the &#8220;Use&#8221; key and then right-clicking the signal
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">All signals that are assigned to a TCB can be configured by first right-clicking them, then selecting &#8220;Influence Point&#8221; in
     the signalling formspec.</li></ul>
<!--l. 255--><p class="noindent" >The small formspec that opens allows you to set and later view or clear the Influence Point. To set the influence point, click the &#8220;Set&#8221;
button, face towards the signal and punch a rail about 2m in front of the signal. A small marker will be shown, indicating success. To
cancel setting an influence point, punch anything other. (note that then the influence point remains unset, regardless of its previous
state)
<!--l. 263--><p class="noindent" >The advtrains-internal train safety system ensures that the train always obeys any restrictions imposed by signals, if (and only if) the
influence point is set properly.

variable signal by traditional means (mesecons, digiline, right-click) if the signal allows it, but that misses the point of this interlocking
system.
<!--l. 274--><p class="noindent" >In the following sections, we will talk about main signals. By this, we mean a variable signal that can display both a &#8220;Danger&#8221; aspect
(trains are not allowed to proceed) and at least one &#8220;Proceed&#8221; aspect (train may proceed as train/shunt move, with optional speed

<a 
 id="Q1-1-0"></a>
<!--l. 283--><p class="noindent" >A so-called route is a locked path between two main signals, which locks all turnouts in the correct position. Its purpose is to offer a train
a path on which it can safely proceed without interfering with any other train. A route always incorporates and locks one to multiple
track sections, starting with the one that lies directly behind the &#8220;entry&#8221; signal.
<!--l. 290--><p class="noindent" >Example: Imagine a station with 2 platforms on a single track running line. We are looking at signal A. You probably want trains coming
from the right to go into platform 1 or into platform 2, so you need to program 2 routes.

<!--l. 297--><p class="noindent" >This leads us to the most important aspect of route programming: Routes always start at a signal (A) and end at a signal facing in the
<span 
class="ecbx-1000">same direction </span>(D and E), not at an opposite-facing signal (B and C). There are only few exceptions, we&#8217;ll cover this
later.
<!--l. 302--><p class="noindent" >When you set a route to make a train proceed on it, the interlocking system ensures that:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">There are no rail vehicles on the route
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">All turnouts are set to the correct position and it is impossible to move them
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">No other routes can be set that would in any way conflict with this route</li></ul>
<!--l. 311--><p class="noindent" >For this to work, you need to specify all track sections the train will pass along, as well as the positions of all turnouts that need to be
locked. Those are not only the turnouts that lay directly on the train&#8217;s route, but also some turnouts on adjacent tracks, the so-called
flank protection.
<!--l. 317--><p class="noindent" >The purpose of flank protection is to prevent runaway trains and/or wagons to pass into a route. This is achieved by setting nearby
turnouts to a position that points &#8220;away&#8221; from the route. Example:
<!--l. 321--><p class="noindent" ><img 
src="7_home_moritz_Home_Projekte_Minetest_minetest_mods_advtrains_assets_lyx_img_route_ex2.png" alt="PIC"  
>
<!--l. 323--><p class="noindent" >The upper turnout, of course, needs to be locked in straight (normal) position, while the lower one is not relevant for the route itself. But
what if the lower turnout was set to the diverging (reverse) position and the driver of another train approaching signal B fails to see the
red light? This train would crash into the first one. To minimise danger, that other train would need to be routed towards signal
D.
<!--l. 330--><p class="noindent" >There are, of course, situations, where both positions of a turnout would conflict with a route equally. In those situations, there&#8217;s nothing

ready on a siding, and want to couple an engine to it? You can not set a regular route into the siding, because it is
occupied.
<!--l. 379--><p class="noindent" >The solution is to program a second route into the siding, but with the difference that it already ends at the rear-facing signal of it, so it
doesn&#8217;t include the siding section itself:

not.

<!--l. 400--><p class="noindent" >In early real-life interlocking systems, routes either had to be cancelled by the signalman after the train had passed the route, or there was
a single release contact at the end of the route. However, as interlocking systems evolved and the position of trains is now
roughly known by the track sections, portions of the route can be freed as soon as the train has left the corresponding
section.
<!--l. 407--><p class="noindent" >AdvTrains has chosen a modern approach to route releasing. Each turnout lock is associated to a track section belonging to the route&#8217;s
path. Once the train leaves this section, all assigned locks are also freed.

real-world interlocking system do not expect this. There is a clear, human-sense rule that you should never reverse the

set.
<!--l. 423--><p class="noindent" >Routes always start at a main signal. You must have assigned the signal to a TCB, as described earlier.

with the possibility to set them or to create new routes. Click the &#8220;Create new route&#8221; button to start programming a new
route.
<!--l. 431--><p class="noindent" >The form closes, and an arrow is displayed on the TCB. You are now in &#8220;Route Programming&#8221; mode, programming the first track section
of the route. Now:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Put any turnouts you need to lock in the correct position (e.g. by right-clicking them). This includes flank protection.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Punch them. This makes a marker with a blue lock symbol appear.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If you punch a turnout again, or punch the marker, you can remove the lock again.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">When you&#8217;ve locked all turnouts in the current section, go to and punch the TCB that is the border to the next track
     section the train proceeds into.</li></ul>
<!--l. 444--><p class="noindent" >Depending on the situation, you are now offered some possibilities to proceed:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Click the &#8220;Advance to next section&#8221; button if your route consists of more sections with turnouts to lock, and you need to
     continue programming. Follow the above steps to set locks for the next section.</li></ul>
<!--l. 451--><p class="noindent" >Once you&#8217;ve clicked the &#8220;Advance&#8221; button, the lock markers change to a red lock symbol, telling they can&#8217;t be changed anymore. Repeat
the above procedure until you are ready to complete the programming procedure:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Click the &#8220;Finish route HERE&#8221; button when you&#8217;ve set up the locks for the last track section of the route and punched the
     final TCB (the one with the next signal). You will be asked for a route name and your route will be saved.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The &#8220;Finish route at end of NEXT section&#8221; button (third button) is an useful quickhand to make the route proceed one
     more section. Using this button is equivalent to first clicking the &#8220;Advance&#8221; button, then flying to the end of the next track
     section and finishing the route there. You can not (officially) set turnout locks in the final section using this method.</li></ul>
<!--l. 467--><p class="noindent" >A few hints:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">If one turnout should be locked by more than one section, set the lock only in the <span 
class="ectt-1000">last </span>of those sections. Locking the same
     turnout in multiple sections of a single route results in undefined behavior!
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If you accidentally advanced the route wrongly, you can use the &#8220;Step back one section&#8221; button to undo this.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If you want to stop programming the entire route without saving it, use the &#8220;Cancel route programming&#8221; button.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The third button is especially useful for programming simple block sections on a main running line, since you can stay at
     the starting signal (punch starting TCB and select third button).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If a route should end in a dead end, you MUST use the &#8220;Finish in NEXT section&#8221; button, because there is no final TCB
     that you could punch.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The third button does NOT work on sections with more than 2 exits, because the system won&#8217;t be able to determine the
     final TCB of the route then.</li></ul>

<!--l. 502--><p class="noindent" >The Train Safety System, called &#8220;LZB&#8221; in the code (from the german term Linienzugbeeinflussung, although this is a completely different
system), ensures that trains obey any restrictions imposed by signals when influence points are set. This way, it is not possible to pass
signals at danger or to bypass speed restrictions.
<!--l. 508--><p class="noindent" >It is possible to overrun red signals, if a route is cancelled while a train is approaching. Real interlocking systems use a mechanism called
Approach locking for this, however, as of now, there&#8217;s no similar system in this mod. If a red signal is overrun, the train brakes using
emergency brake (&#8220;BB&#8221;) and can not be moved any further. You should then examine the situation and drive the train backwards out of
the section.
